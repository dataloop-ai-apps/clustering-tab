# Clustering app

Leveraging TensorFlow's TensorBoard Embedding Projector.

### Overview

The Clustering App is an innovative extension of the [TensorBoard Embedding Projector](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard), tailored to integrate seamlessly with the Dataloop platform and its datasets. This enhancement empowers Dataloop users by providing a robust 3D/2D visualization tool, specifically designed to explore and understand complex relationships within their data.

### Key Enhancements

- **Integration with Dataloop**: Optimized to work effortlessly with the Dataloop platform.

- **Seamless Integration with Dataloop Annotations**: Tailored to work fluidly with Dataloopâ€™s annotated datasets, enabling a deeper analysis of annotated data elements.

### Prerequisites

- **Embeddings Model Installation**: Users must install an embeddings model into their Dataloop datasets. This step is crucial for the app to process and visualize data.

### Using the Clustering App

- As an integral part of the Dataloop platform, the Clustering App requires no separate installation.

### Custom Development

- For those interested in custom development or modifications of the Clustering App, it is recommended to follow the same approach as outlined in the original [TensorBoard Embedding Projector repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard).
- Ensure adherence to the guidelines and best practices specified in the original repository to maintain compatibility and performance.
